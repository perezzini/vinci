## Some important requirements

- Splash package: a Javascript rendering service. Used to render dynamic websites.

## Crawler
Implemented some spiders to crawl certain *legal* websites from the Argentinian Gov.

### Some project's considarations
- Use `python_version = "3.6"` on Ubuntu 18.04. And `python_version = "3.5"` on Ubuntu 16.04. [This have been probably fixed: just use `python_version = "3.5"`]
